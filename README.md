# FTL: Captain's Log

What is it? FTL: Captain's Log is intended to be a dynamic database primarily for use with modded content in FTL. Have you ever tried to browse a wiki for modded content and you figured out that it hasn't been maintained in years and/or one or more of your mods aren't a part of a wiki at all? With Captain's Log, that issue is gone, as content is added to the database dynamically from your files, ensuring that no content goes unnoticed!
